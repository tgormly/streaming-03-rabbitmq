Message listener 

Description:
This script continuously listens for messages on a named queue.
This terminal must be open and dedicated to this process. 
(If you want to emit messages, open a different terminal window.)

Remember:
- Use Control + C to close a terminal and end the listening process.
- Use the up arrow to recall the last command executed in the terminal.

    Callback function to process a received message.
    The signature of this function is defined by the Pika library.

    Parameters:
    - ch: The channel object from RabbitMQ. It provides methods to interact with the protocol,
          but we don't need them in this particular callback.
    - method: Contains details about the delivery method and its properties,
              such as the delivery tag or the exchange/routing key.
              We don't use it in this example.
    - properties: Message properties like content_type or delivery_mode.
                  Not used here since we're focused on the message body.
    - body: The body of the message (the actual content).
